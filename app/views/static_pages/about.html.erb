	Introduction
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	ProveIt is an on-line debate and discussion forum designed for people passionate about their opinions and
	confident in their ability to defend them with facts and sound logic. It solves two major problems found in similar
	websites:
</p>
<ol class="paragraph">
	<li>
		Although many existing Internet debate and discussion forums host lively and contentious arguments, they offer
		nothing to help separate truth from fiction or expose fallacies and biases. The final result is usually a jumbled
		collection of obtuse insinuations, implied objections and personal attacks. Valid points are often ignored or lost
		in the clutter. Personal opinions are rarely changed as a result. Some of these forums provide voting mechanisms
		designed to identify a "winner" but this approach is woefully subjective and effectively meaningless. ProveIt
		strongly believes that debate outcomes should be based on objective facts and logic rather than popular sentiment.
	</li>
	<li>
		Discussion threads in most Internet forums are difficult to read. They invariably utilize a linear style format
		with the entire dialogue displayed in a single scrollable list. It's possible that any given comment is in response
		to another post hundreds of lines above it. Anything beyond the simplest discourse quickly becomes mentally
		unmanageable.
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="paragraph">
	ProveIt solves the first problem with its primary objective to validate (or invalidate) any opinion presumed to be
	based on facts (as opposed to personal perspective or bias). Basically, a debate in ProveIt is represented by a
	multi-level graphical tree structure whose nodes consist of an initial opinion (level 0) followed by a cascading
	barrage of responses any number of levels deep. (See figure 1) It's important to understand <u><em>these responses are
	strictly limited to objections</em></u> – as opposed to the usual variety of questions, implications, and passive
	aggressive insinuations. When first submitted, an opinion will be shaded green (suggesting valid). It will remain that
	way until contested with one or more objections. At this point it will become red (suggesting invalid) and the
	objections will be green. Supporters of an opinion will examine its objections looking for inaccurate facts and flawed
	logic, and possibly contest them with their own objections causing their status to revert to red. And on and on it
	goes. As a debate grows over time, it will start looking like a virtual Christmas tree with objections (and possibly
	the initial opinion) toggling back and forth between green and red. A post will remain green as long as it has no
	valid objections but all it takes is one to render it red. Eventually, all conceivable objections at all levels will
	be thoroughly analyzed exposing any falsehoods and/or fallacies. Objections cannot be ignored or overlooked without
	consequences. They must be either challenged or conceded. As a debate's branches eventually become atomized and fully
	resolved, its initial opinion will converge on red or green. The "losing" side will have little choice but to
	capitulate. His arguments will have been exposed as false or weak and he will be rendered powerless to change the
	final outcome.

</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	ProveIt solves the second problem by permitting users to drill into debates allowing them to focus on
	individual nodes and their direct objections. If desired, they can display these objections in "Expanded Mode"
	revealing all levels of offspring or "Collapsed Mode" to display direct objections only. For even greater visual
	efficiency, users can adjust their overall verbosity level (as well as individual posts) further controlling the
	amount of information displayed.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	ProveIt's secondary objectives are the following:
	<ol class="paragraph">
		<li>
			Create a debate forum in which "truth" is revealed and popular sentiment (voting) is irrelevant. It's not about
			finding the most popular answer. It's about finding the correct answer.
 		</li>
		<li>
			Create a debate forum that encourages thoughtful posts and open-minded discourse. It's not about "winning" the
			debate. It's about learning the truth! It's about probing deep within our psyches and discovering our own biases
			and motivations.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a debate forum that discourages "hip shot" responses and the urge to ram half-baked opinions down
			everyone's throat.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a debate forum that rewards truth and accuracy.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a tool to assist with identifying logical fallacies and cognitive biases.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provide links and blogs educating users on basic logic, argumentative theory, philosophy and, of course,
			"The ProveIt Way!".
		</li>
		<li>
			Make online debating fun. A scoring and ranking system will reward top users.
		</li>

		Features:
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Topic types --  There are three topic types users can create: Opinions (red or green), Initiators (yellow), and
		Casual (blue). Opinions are expressed as personal beliefs (typically controversial). Initiators are used to solicit
		opinions (without committing to one yourself). Casual topics can be anything the poster thinks will be interesting
		or amusing.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Templates -- Objections can be generated manually or selected from a database of pre-defined templates including
		logical fallacies and cognitive biases. Future enhancements will include a "wizard" that will assist with
		identifying these fallacies and biases.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Sidebars -- While it's important that debates be limited to objections, the ability to post anything else (questions,
		observations, etc.) is possible in parallel sidebars. Participants and authorized observers can post unrestricted
		(within reason) comments to any node within a debate tree. It should be understood that the "meat" of a debate takes
		place in the objections. The sidebars are where informal discussions take place.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Privacy -- When creating a new topic, the originator must decide whether to declare it public or private. A public
		debate means anyone can participate. A private debate requires him to identify participants and declare whether to
		allow "Public Viewing" and "Public Sidebars". This determines whether the public will be permitted to view the
		debate and/or post comments even while blocked from participating. For example, imagine a private debate on gun
		control between two heavyweight political pundits like Michael Moore & Rand Paul with public viewing and public
		sidebars turned on. Anyone could watch and post comments but not engage in the actual debate. This would be the
		debating equivalent of an Ali vs. Frazier boxing match! The most popular of such debates are displayed in the
		"Marquee" list.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Lone Wolf -- Because debates are limited to objections only (other than sidebars), by definition, all even-level
		posts are in support of the initial opinion while all odd-level posts are in opposition. This allows for
		an interesting feature called "Lone Wolf". When starting a new debate the originator can select this option which
		basically pits him alone against the world. This means only he will be permitted to post even-level objections and
		vice-versa. This feature is intended for people confident in their knowledge on the given subject and don't want any
		help defending their position.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Channels --  A cousin of the "Lone Wolf", a Channel is a Casual topic that similarly restricts interaction between
		participants. The OP can only respond to other people while other people can only respond to the OP. So it's like an
		AMA ("Ask Me Anything", in Reddit), only better. An AMA is nothing but a subreddit in which the OP promises to
		participate for a short time. That's it. Anyone can respond to anyone. A Channel will provide a personal forum in
		which the OP can respond to as many questions as he likes, whenever he likes, as long as he likes (perhaps
		indefinitely). Keep in mind, only he can respond to questions/comments so the topic remains very uncluttered. The
		most popular Channels are displayed in the "Top Channels" list.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Teams -- Private and Semi-private topics (Opinions and Initiators) can be divided into teams if desired. With
		Opinions, this means one team will argue in favor of the Initial Opinion while the other will argue against it. This
		is possible due to the “objections only” rule. All even level objections serve to support the initial opinion while
		all odd objections oppose it. Because of this it's trivial to restrict each team's ability to submit replies
		accordingly. With Initiators, each Initial Opinion submitted is treated as above. Teammates are forced into
		lockstep agreement with their objections.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Scoring  -- The nature of the website encourages, if not enforces, thoughtful and reasonable discourse. A
		scoring/rating system keeps track of user performance and ranks everyone accordingly. So while ProveIt is an
		effective tool for revealing the truth, it's also fun! Competitive users become very interested (if not obsessed)
		with defending their opinions and maintaining their ratings.
	</p>

</div>

<p class="paragraph">
	Although users will appreciate the mechanisms provided within ProveIt to help validate their opinions, they should
	understand its ultimate purpose is to foster rational thought and reveal the truth no matter where it lies. Seasoned
	users recognize this and embrace the virtues of patience, thoughtfulness, and understanding. They are a very
	introspective bunch and have learned to not only recognize the pervasiveness of cognitive biases in others but to
	realize their own opinions are often tainted as well. They have learned to think before they post and check their
	biases before attacking anyone they disagree with. They never initiate or enter a debate with a bull-headed attitude
	determined to prove themselves right, but rather to seek the truth and learn.
