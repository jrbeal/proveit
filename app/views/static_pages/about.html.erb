	Introduction
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	<b>ProveIt!</b> is an on-line debate and discussion forum designed for people passionate about their opinions and
	confident in their ability to defend them with facts and sound logic. It solves two major problems found in similar
	websites:
</p>
<ol class="paragraph">
	<li>
		Although many existing Internet debate and discussion forums host lively and contentious arguments, they offer
		nothing to help separate truth from fiction or expose fallacies and biases. The final result is usually a jumbled
		collection of obtuse insinuations, implied objections and personal attacks. Valid points are often ignored or lost
		in the clutter. Personal opinions are rarely changed as a result. Some of these forums provide voting mechanisms
		designed to identify a "winner" but this approach is woefully subjective and effectively meaningless. ProveIt
		strongly believes that debate outcomes should be based on objective facts and logic rather than popular sentiment.
	</li>
	<li>
		Discussion threads in most Internet forums are difficult to read. They invariably utilize a linear style format
		with the entire dialogue displayed in a single scrollable list. It's possible that any given comment is in response
		to another post hundreds of lines above it. Anything beyond the simplest discourse quickly becomes mentally
		unmanageable.
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="paragraph">
	ProveIt solves the first problem with its primary objective to validate (or invalidate) any opinion presumed to be
	based on facts (as opposed to personal perspective or bias). Basically, a debate in ProveIt is represented by a
	multi-level graphical tree structure whose nodes consist of an initial opinion (level 0) followed by a cascading
	barrage of responses any number of levels deep. It's important to understand <u><em>these responses are strictly
	limited to objections</em></u> – as opposed to the usual variety of questions, implications, insinuations, etc. When
	first submitted, an opinion will be shaded green (suggesting valid). It will remain that way until contested with one
	or more objections. At this point it will become red (suggesting invalid) and the objections will be green. Supporters
	of an opinion will examine its objections looking for inaccurate facts and flawed logic, and possibly contest them
	with their own objections causing their status to revert to red. And on and on it goes. As a debate grows over time,
	it will start looking like a virtual Christmas tree with objections (and possibly the initial opinion) toggling back
	and forth between green and red. A post will remain green as long as it has no valid objections but all it takes is
	one to render it red. Eventually, all conceivable objections at all levels will be thoroughly analyzed exposing any
	falsehoods and/or fallacies. Objections cannot be ignored or overlooked without consequences. They must be either
	challenged or conceded. As a debate's branches eventually become atomized and fully resolved, its initial opinion
	will converge on red or green. The "losing" side will have little choice but to capitulate. His arguments will have
	been exposed as false or weak and he will be rendered powerless to change the final outcome.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	ProveIt solves the second problem by permitting users to dive as deep as desired into debates allowing them to focus
	on individual nodes and their direct objections. If desired, they can choose to display these objections in "Expanded
	Mode" revealing all levels of offspring or "Collapsed Mode" to display direct objections only. For even greater visual
	efficiency, users can adjust their default verbosity level (as well as individual posts) further controlling the
	amount of information displayed.

	<p class="title">
		Features:
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Topic types --  Users can create three topic types: Opinions (red or green), Initiators (yellow), and Casual (blue).
		Opinions are personal beliefs (typically controversial) that must be supported with valid justification. Initiators
		are used to solicit opinions (without committing to one yourself). Casual topics can be anything the poster thinks
		will be interesting or amusing.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Templates -- Objections can be generated manually or selected from a database of pre-defined templates including
		logical fallacies and cognitive biases. Future enhancements will include a "wizard" that will assist with
		identifying these fallacies and biases.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Sidebars -- While it's important that debates be limited to objections, the ability to post anything else (questions,
		observations, etc.) is possible in parallel sidebars. Participants and authorized observers can post unrestricted
		(within reason) comments to any node within a debate tree. It should be understood that the "meat" of a debate takes
		place in the objections. The sidebars are where informal discussions occur.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Privacy -- When creating a new topic, the originator must decide whether to declare it public or private. A public
		debate means anyone can participate. A private debate requires him to identify participants and declare whether to
		allow "Public Viewing" and "Public Sidebars". This determines whether the public will be permitted to view these
		debates and/or post comments even while blocked from participating. For example, imagine a private debate on gun
		control between two heavyweight political pundits like Michael Moore & Rand Paul with public viewing turned on and
		sidebars allowed. The public could watch and post comments but not engage in the actual debate. This would be the
		debating equivalent of an Ali vs. Frazier boxing match! Such matches are displayed in the "Marquee" list.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Lone Wolf -- Because debate responses are limited to objections only (other than sidebars), by definition, all
		even-level posts are in support of the initial opinion while all odd-level posts are in opposition. This allows for
		an interesting feature called "Lone Wolf". When starting a new debate the originator can select this option which
		basically pits him alone against the world. This means only he will be permitted to post objections to odd-level
		posts and vice-versa. This feature is intended for people confident in their knowledge on the given subject and
		don't want any help defending their position.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		My Faqs --  A cousin of the "Lone Wolf", a Faq is a Casual topic that restricts interaction between participants.
		The OP can only respond to other people while other people can only respond to the OP. So it's like an AMA ("Ask Me
		Anything", in Reddit), only better. An AMA is nothing but a subreddit in which the OP promises to participate for a
		short time. That's it. Anyone can respond to anyone. A Faq will provide a personal forum in which the OP can respond
		to as many questions as he likes, whenever he likes, as long as he likes (perhaps indefinitely). Keep in mind, only
		he can respond to questions so the topic remains very uncluttered. The most popular Faqs are displayed in the "Top
		Faqs" list.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Teams -- Private and Semi-private topics (Opinions and Initiators) can be divided into teams if desired.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		Scoring  -- The nature of the website encourages, if not enforces, thoughtful and reasonable discourse. A
		scoring/rating system keeps track of user performance and ranks everyone accordingly. So while ProveIt is an
		effective tool for revealing the truth, it's also fun! Competitive users become very interested (if not obsessed)
		with defending their opinions and maintaining their ratings.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		API's -- Two API's are offered to external websites interested in integrating ProveIt into their discussion forums.
		One is used to submit locally generated opinions to the ProveIt website where it will be debated. The other will
		query the status of the submitted opinion. The result can be used to identify the local opinion as "true" or "false"
		in some fashion. For example, sites like Facebook can integrate these API's allowing users to flag opinions with a
		"ProveIt!" icon and watch its validity play out remotely. Opinions submitted using this API will be tagged in
		ProveIt! revealing to its users that it came from an external source. Links will be provided allowing users to
		navigate between the two sites.
	</p>
</div>

<p class="paragraph">
	Although users will appreciate the mechanisms provided within ProveIt to help validate their opinions, they understand
	its ultimate purpose is to foster rational thought within the community and identify the "truth" of all things
	important. Of course, savvy readers will immediately note the subjective nature of this word and point out the
	philosophical pitfalls awaiting anyone who dares to define it. Seasoned users are aware of this and have embraced
	the virtues of patience and understanding. They are a very introspective bunch and have learned to not only recognize
	the pervasiveness of cognitive biases in other people but realize their own opinions are often tainted as well. They
	have learned to think before they post and check their biases before attacking anyone they disagree with. They never
	initiate or enter a debate with a bull-headed attitude determined to prove themselves right, but to seek the truth
	and learn.
